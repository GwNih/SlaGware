This is a script to repackage a Debian/Ubuntu Google Earth .deb package
for Slackware.  Run this script in the same directory as one of these
binary packages:

  google-earth-stable_current_amd64.deb  (for 64-bit x86_64)
  google-earth-stable_current_i386.deb   (for 32-bit x86)
  
This will create a Slackware .txz package.  Install it with installpkg
or use upgradepkg to upgrade from a previous version.
